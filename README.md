### Hello, I'm Saksham Rawat :)
I'm an Electrical Engineering undergrad who's way too into digital design, control systems, and hardware-level-development. Most of my free time is spent pretending I know what I'm doing with anything.

Right now, I'm trying to build a RISC-V processor from scratch.

When I'm not buried in working/studying (or procrastinating), you'll probably catch me scrolling Reddit, watching WWE or any sports for that matter, or vibing to random music like it's a full-time job.

I believe in learning by doing — and this profile is where I share that journey.
