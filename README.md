### Hello, I'm Saksham Rawat :)

I'm an Electrical Engineering undergrad with a strong interest in digital design, control systems, and hardware-level development. I enjoy building projects in Verilog and exploring how things work at the circuit and system level.

Currently, I’m working on developing a RISC-V processor from scratch and diving deeper into FPGA design.

When I'm not working (or procrasstinating) you’ll probably find me scrolling reddit, watching wwe or listening to music.

I believe in learning by doing — and this profile is where I share that journey.
